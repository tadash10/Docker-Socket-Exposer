# Docker-Socket-Exposer
Here's a high-level Python script that detects and takes proper action to expose a socket in Docker:
The Docker Socket Exposer is a Python script that automates the process of exposing sockets for Docker containers. It allows you to check if the containers have exposed ports, and if not, it gracefully stops the container, cleans up any previously exposed sockets, starts the container if not running, and finally exposes the required socket.
Installation

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/docker-socket-exposer.git
cd docker-socket-exposer

    Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv

    Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows

venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS and Linux

bash

source venv/bin/activate

    Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

To use the Docker Socket Exposer, follow the steps below:

    Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine and that the Docker daemon is running.

    Customize the docker_socket_exposer.py file:
        Replace /path/to/your/application in the expose_socket function with the actual path to your application that you want to expose within the container.

    Execute the main.py script:

css

python main.py

The script will perform the following steps for each Docker container:

    Check if the container has any exposed ports.
    If no ports are exposed, it will stop the container gracefully, clean up any previously exposed sockets, start the container (if not running), and then expose the required socket.

The script will log its actions and any errors encountered in the docker_socket_exposer.log file.

Note: If you encounter any issues during execution, please refer to the logs in the docker_socket_exposer.log file for more details.
